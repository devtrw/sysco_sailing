    p.lead Collection of your  Personal Information
    p SYSCO collects personally identifiable information, such as your e-mail
      address, name, home or work address or telephone number. SYSCO also collects
      anonymous demographic information, which is not unique to you, such as your
      ZIP code, age, gender, preferences, interests and favorites.
    p There is also information about your computer hardware and software that is
      automatically collected by the SYSCO Web site. This information can include:
      your IP address, browser type, domain names, access times and referring Web
      site addresses. This information is used by SYSCO for the operation of the
      service, to maintain quality of the service, and to provide general statistics
      regarding use of the SYSCO Web site.
    p Please keep in mind that if you directly disclose personally identifiable
      information or personally sensitive data through SYSCO public message boards,
      this information may be collected and used by others. Note: SYSCO does not
      read any of your private online communications.
    p SYSCO encourages you to review the privacy statements of Web sites you
      choose to link to from SYSCO so that you can understand how those Web sites
      collect, use and share your information. SYSCO is not responsible for the
      privacy statements or other content on Web sites outside of the SYSCO and
      SYSCO family of Web sites.

    p.lead Use of your Personal Information
    p SYSCO collects and uses your personal information to operate the SYSCO Web
      site and deliver the services you have requested. SYSCO also uses your
      personally identifiable information to inform you of other products or
      services available from SYSCO and its affiliates. SYSCO may also contact you
      via surveys to conduct research about your opinion of current services or of
      potential new services that may be offered.
    p SYSCO does not sell, rent or lease its customer lists to third parties.
    p SYSCO may, from time to  time, contact you on behalf of external business
      partners about a particular offering that may be of interest to you. In those
      cases, your unique personally identif iable information (e-mail, name,
      address, telephone number) is not transferred to the third party.
      In addition, SYSCO may share data with trusted partners to help us perform
      statistical analysis, send you email or postal mail, provide customer
      support, or arrange for deliveries. All such third parties are prohibited
      from using your personal information except to provide these services to the
      SYSCO Web site, and they are required to maintain the confidentiality of
      your information.
    p SYSCO does not use or disclose sensitive personal information, such as
      race, religion, or political affiliations, without your explicit consent.
    p SYSCO keeps track of the Web sites and pages our customers visit within the
      SYSCO Web site, in order to determine what SYSCO services are the most
      popular. This data is used to deliver customized content and advertising
      within SYSCO to customers whose behavior indicates that they are interested
      in a particular subject area.
    p SYSCO Web sites will disclose your personal information, without notice,
      only if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such action
      is necessary to: (a) conform to the edicts of the law or comply with legal
      process served on SYSCO or the site; (b) protect and defend the rights or
      property of SYSCO; and, (c) act under exigent circumstances to protect the
      personal safety of users of  the SYSCO Web site, or the public.

    p.lead Use of Cookies
    p The SYSCO Web site use "cookies" to help you personalize your online
      experience. A cookie is a text file that is placed on your hard disk
      by a Web page server. Cookies  cannot be used to run programs or deliver
      viruses to your computer. Cookies are  uniquely assigned to you, and
      can only be read by a web server in the domain that issued the cookie
      to you.
    p One of the primary purposes of cookies is to provide a convenience
      feature to save you time. The purpose of a cookie is to tell the Web
      server that you have returned to a specific page. For example, if you
      personalize SYSCO pages, or register with SYSCO  site or services, a
      cookie helps SYSCO to recall your specific information on  subsequent
      visits. This simplifies the process of recording your personal
      information, such as billing addresses, shipping addresses, and so on.
      When you return to the same SYSCO Web site, the information you
      previously provided can be retrieved, so you can easily use the
      SYSCO features that you customized.
    p You have the ability to accept or decline cookies. Most Web browsers
      automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser
      setting to decline cookies if you  prefer. If you choose to decline
      cookies, you may not be able to fully experience the interactive
      features of the SYSCO services or Web sites you visit.

    p.lead Security of your Personal Information
    p SYSCO secures your personal information from unauthorized access, use
      or disclosure. SYSCO secures the personally identifiable information
      you provide on computer servers in a controlled, secure environment,
      protected from unauthorized access, use or disclosure. When personal
      information (such as a credit card number) is transmitted to other Web
      sites, it is protected through the use of encryption,
      such as the Secure Socket Layer (SSL) protocol.

  div.list-group-item
    p.lead Changes to this Statement
    p SYSCO will occasionally update this Statement of Privacy to reflect
      company and customer feedback. SYSCO encourages you to periodically
      review this Statement to be informed of how SYSCO is protecting your
      information.
