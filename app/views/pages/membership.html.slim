    p The Club currently represents Oregonâ€™s largest sailboat racing and
      cruising fleet. Its membership is comprised of several level fleets
      and one-design classes, with keelboats and trimarans 19' and up.
      Membership dues are low and fund a full year of informative meetings,
      recreational cruises, an active racing program, and monthly newsletters.

    p SYSCO promotes sailboat racing as a means to foster the development of
      boat handling skills and confidence. Racing provides sailors a learning
      experience to improve the performance and safety of their boats. Racing
      also provides excellent instruction in right-of-way rules, crew teamwork,
      and sportsmanship. Families are encouraged to participate as a team.
